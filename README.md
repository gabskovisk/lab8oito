## Minibio about Lab8oito
------------------------
<br>
Lab 8 is a hybrid lab. They do it like a traditional analogue lab - the little red room of cinema films - the film development stage, but to obtain the images they use digital means, the famous scanners. They're fisically located in Fortaleza, CearÃ¡, Brazil.
